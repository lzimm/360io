-- this is fairly old school work yo --



anyways, standard disclaimer:

there's a bunch of extra junk in here you probably don't need to run it,
while on the other hand, its probably missing some stuff you do
(as well as any explanation of how all this junk works,
license information that i probably stripped from a bunch of files
and any sort of sanity). so funny.
